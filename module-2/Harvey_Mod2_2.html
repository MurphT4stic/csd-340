     <p class="intro">I grew up in Bellevue Nebraska as a Navy brat. Bellevue is a nice quiet place, that can be boring unless you have a good group around you. </p>
     <p>I'm a Navy vet with 8 years of service under my belt. After I left the Navy I obtained my first degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>
     <p>Moved to Arizona in 2023 and currently on this journey for my second degree in Software Development. </p>
     <p><span class="sentence">My hobbies include video games, exercising, reading, traveling, and recently coding with some drawing on the side.</span> I used to draw and I stopped in high school, with this 
        new motivation in coding it has inspired me to draw again. </p>
